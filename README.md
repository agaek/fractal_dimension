# fractal_dimension
Python OpenCV and box-counting (Minkowskiâ€“Bouligand) method for calculating the fractal dimension of an object in the image. 

fractal_dim_final - contains just the functions to determine the fractal dimensions of an object in the image 
helpscripts - additional scripts I used, described below 


I wrote this program when doing research on viscous fingering, so this repository also includes some code to detect the radius of the circular object (the fractal I was investigating in my case), and to apply these functions to a video by splitting it into frames. It may include a DLA (Diffusion Limited Aggregation) simulation sometime later.  
In the 'photo and video examples' folder, I attach some of the images I used my program to process. Changing some of the image preprocessing parameters might be needed for different images.
